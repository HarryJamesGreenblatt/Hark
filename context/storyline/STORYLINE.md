# 🧭 HARK Storyline — Session Handoff Log

An **episodic** record of distinctive working sessions on HARK. Each episode encapsulates one
session's intent, decisions, changes, and loose threads — so any future session (human or agent)
can resume with full context instead of starting cold.

> **Read order for a cold start:** this file's _Current State_ snapshot → the latest episode →
> earlier episodes only if you need the "why" behind a decision.
>
> Prior art: [`../../problem-statement.md`](../../problem-statement.md) is the original brief
> (treat it as **Episode 0** — the pre-implementation research/design handoff).

## 📌 Current State (snapshot)

_Last updated: 2026-08-19 (end of Episode 5)._

- **Status:** CLI MVP + desktop overlay working, published to the public personal repo
  `github.com/HarryJamesGreenblatt/Hark`. The overlay is now a **multi-speaker** experience:
  reliable multi-language captions, real-time speaker diarization, per-speaker pages, and an
  AI recap with a CAPTIONS/SUMMARY mode switch.
- **Branch:** `main` · working tree clean.
- **Apps:** `Hark.Cli` (terminal) and `Hark.App` (WPF tray overlay) drive the shared
  `Hark.Core/HarkSession`. `Hark.App`: starts hidden; `Ctrl+Win+H` toggles the bar; header has a
  ✕ close button. In the desktop app, diarization is on — captions are attributed to anonymous
  `Guest-N` speakers, each with a clickable pill that opens a dedicated page; a segmented
  **CAPTIONS / SUMMARY** switch cross-fades to a Teams-style recap.
- **Pipeline engines (`Hark.Core`):**
  - Non-diarized: `AzureSpeechTranscriber` with **continuous language identification** (mixed
    languages) when no language is pinned.
  - Diarized: `ConversationDiarizingTranscriber` (`ConversationTranscriber`, pinned language,
    `Guest-N` labels). Selected via `HarkSession(diarize: …)` — defaults **off** (CLI unchanged).
  - Recap: `ISummarizer` / `AzureOpenAiSummarizer` (styles: Teams / Narrative / PerSpeaker).
- **Source of truth (desktop):** `Hark.App/ConversationStore` — combined + per-speaker transcript,
  written UI-thread-only from `OverlaySink` (finalized segments), with a `Revision` counter used to
  cache summaries (reuse when captions unchanged; regenerate on new speech/session).
- **Auth:** `AzureCliCredential` (explicit), keyless. Requires `az login` with the
  **Cognitive Services Speech User** role on the Speech resource, and — for recaps — the
  appropriate **Azure OpenAI** data-plane role on that resource.
- **Config:** all sensitive values live outside source. Speech region/resource id via env var →
  `dotnet user-secrets`; Azure OpenAI endpoint + deployment via `dotnet user-secrets`
  (`HARK_AOAI_ENDPOINT`, `HARK_AOAI_DEPLOYMENT`). Missing recap config shows a friendly inline note.
- **How to run:** VS **F5** per project, or `.\run.ps1` (CLI), or raw `dotnet run` — after the
  one-time user-secrets setup for the resources you're targeting.
- **`gh` auth:** enterprise (`hgreenblatt_microsoft`) and personal (`HarryJamesGreenblatt`, owns the
  repo) both configured; `gh auth switch` to flip.
- **Known env gotcha:** the Azure CLI can crash on a broken ACL under
  `~/.azure/cliextensions/account/...` → worked around by **running VS elevated**.

## 🔓 Open threads (carried forward)

These are unresolved at the end of the latest episode — natural starting points for the next one.

- **Summary smoke test (Episode 5):** set the Azure OpenAI user-secrets (`HARK_AOAI_ENDPOINT`,
  `HARK_AOAI_DEPLOYMENT`), grant the signed-in identity the appropriate **Azure OpenAI** data-plane
  role, then verify a live recap and the cache-reuse behavior (toggle SUMMARY↔CAPTIONS).
- **README/docs:** document the new summary secrets (variable names only) and the required role,
  alongside the existing Speech setup.
- **Recap styles / persistence:** Teams is the default; consider persisting the chosen style and
  richer per-speaker recaps.
- **Diarization caveats:** `Guest-N` labels are anonymous and session-scoped and can occasionally
  swap/merge; consider a rename/merge affordance.
- **Personal Azure resources (deferred):** provision Speech **and** Azure OpenAI resources under a
  personal subscription, `az login` as that identity, assign the data-plane roles, and point
  `dotnet user-secrets` at them — fully decouples HARK from the enterprise account.
- **Tests:** no coverage yet for `PcmConverter`, the `HarkSession` lifecycle, or `ConversationStore`.
- **Overlay polish (optional):** drag-from-anywhere (except while selecting); click-through toggle;
  persistent settings (position, opacity, font size) vs env vars.
- **Permanent CLI fix:** replace the "run elevated" workaround with an ACL repair
  (`icacls "$env:USERPROFILE\.azure\cliextensions\account" /reset /T /C /Q`) or
  `az extension remove --name account`.
- **Launcher parity (optional):** align `run.ps1` defaults with the VS "with transcripts" profile.
- **Pending memory:** approve/save the credential convention (see Episode 1 → Decisions).
